## Competition Overview  
This project is part of a coding challenge for **Dr. Ahmed Salah's Algorithms course**. The goal is to build a program that finds similar images by comparing their color patterns.  

**My Achievement:**  
üèÜ **Ranked 5th** in the competition by creating an efficient solution
## Competition Objectives
1. Implement core algorithms for histogram-based image comparison
2. Demonstrate proficiency in parallel programming concepts
3. Optimize for both correctness and execution speed
4. Apply statistical analysis techniques to image processing

## Technical Requirements
### Mandatory Implementation
```csharp
public static ImageInfo CalculateImageStats(string imgPath) { ... }
public static ImageInfo[] LoadAllImages(string[] targetPaths) { ... }
public static MatchInfo[] FindTopMatches(...) { ... }
